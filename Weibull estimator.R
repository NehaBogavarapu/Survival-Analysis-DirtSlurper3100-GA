# Weibull ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Battery model (using status as event indicator: 1 means failure (Damage), 0 means censored (OK))

weibull_battery <- survreg(Surv(Total.usage.time, Battery.status) ~ Pets + Carpet.score,

summary(weibull_battery)
# Pets =             0.15543 ---> having pets increases log survival time, so longer survival time (less damage/failure) for battery when pets present.
# Carpet.score =     -0.01869 ---> higher carpet score reduces survival time (battery fails sooner).
# Scale = exp(-1.58) â‰ˆ 0.205 ---> shape parameter < 1 means hazard rate decreases over time (failures happen early, then decrease).

# Impact sensor model

# Model did not converge properly so NA values 
# Looks wrong - log likelihood values are crazy (negative and huge)
# Maybe too few failures?
